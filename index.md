Hello!

My name is Alessandro and I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Society, Politics and Sustainability at the ESADE Business School.  received my PhD in International Relations from the London School of Economics and Political Science in 2020, with a dissertation on the systemic effects of labor rights promotion in global trade. From 2020 to 2024, I held a postdoctoral fellowship at the Centre for Corporate Reputation at Oxford Saïd Business School.
I am also affiliated with the University of Oxford as a Research Associate at the Global Economic Governance Programme.

My research examines how global trade affects labor standards, with a focus on workers’ perceptions of what explains differences in working conditions between firms producing for export markets and those serving domestic markets. I conduct fieldwork in Morocco and work closely with local partners and international buyers to study labor regulation in global value chains.

At ESADE, I teach courses on global political economy and international business at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels, and I supervise doctoral research on trade, labor governance, and development.

I hold a PhD in International Political Economy and previously held a postdoctoral position at the University of Oxford.
