Hello!

My name is Alessandro and I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Society, Politics and Sustainability at the ESADE Business School.

My research investigates how global trade shapes labor standards, with a particular focus on the study of labor regulation in global value chains. I employ field experiments, spatial econometrics, and original survey data to examine how firms respond to international scrutiny, private regulation, and institutional incentives, with special attention to workers’ expectations and lived experiences. My research appears in peer-reviewed journals such as *International Studies Quarterly* and *Climate Policy*. At ESADE, I teach courses on global political economy and geopolitics at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels.

I was previously a postdoctoral research fellow at the Centre for Corporate Reputation at Oxford Saïd Business School (2020–2024). I received my PhD in International Relations from the London School of Economics and Political Science in 2020 with a dissertation on the systemic effects of labor rights promotion in global trade. My academic education also includes an MSc in Global Politics from LSE (2015, Distinction) and an MA in International Law from the University of Milan (2014, Honours).
